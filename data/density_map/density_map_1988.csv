Additionally, several media representatives received letters from the group, also claiming their involvement in the incident. In 1991, Marc Leslie Davis, Margaret Katherine Millet, Ilse Washington Asplund, and Marc Andre Baker were sentenced for the attacks on the Fairfield Snow Bowl ski resort. No casualties resulted from the incident, but there was property damage, which amounted to over $26,000, after the previous incident in November 1987, and this incident combined.",Business,Evan Mecham Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy (EMETIC)

The bomb was placed under bushes near an executive doorway and a parking space used by the founder and chairman of the corporation, Leon Hirsch, and the device(according to Trutt) was intended to scare Hirsch into stopping the company's use of live dogs in research and in testing its surgical stapling products on the animals. Trutt was arrested at the time she planted the bomb, but was intending to wait until 8am to detonate the bomb when Hirsch arrived to work. The bomb later detonated when police attempted to dismantle it at another location after the device was seized. Trutt was eventually charged, pleaded no-contest, and was sentenced to one year in prison followed by three years of probation for the attempted murder.",Business,Animal Rights extremists
