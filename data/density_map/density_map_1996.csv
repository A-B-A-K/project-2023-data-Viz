199607270003,United States,33.74502,-84.391669,1.0,"07/27/1996: At 1:25 Saturday morning, a pipe bomb detonated in Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. At the time of the explosion there was a crowd of approximately 60,000 people in the park attending a concert and festivities in celebration of the 1996 Olympic Games. One person was killed as a direct result of the explosion and 111 were injured, including six state troopers and one Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent. A cameraman suffered a heart attack and died while running toward the scene. A call to 911 from a nearby phone booth warned ""There is bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes."" However, there were delays in communicating this message to authorities in the park, where the bomb was found about five minutes before it exploded. Analysts suspect that the call was intended to lure law enforcement officials to the park to injure them. Authorities initially and erroneously suspected that the person who found the bomb under a bench in the park and warned authorities about it was responsible for planting the device. In 2005, Eric Rudolph was convicted and sentenced to four life terms for carrying out this attack and others, including the bombing of an abortion clinic in January 1997 and the bombing of a gay and lesbian bar in February 1997.",Private Citizens & Property,Army of God

One device was lit and placed on the roof of the station, and the second ignited in the back of one of the United States Forest Service (USFS) pickup trucks. The one on the roof failed to detonate, but the arson from the second incendiary caused about $21,500 worth of damage to the ranger station facilities. There were no casualties in the incident. Ferguson and Overtaker also spray-painted graffiti on the trucks and walls of the building with slogans such as “Earth Liberation Front,"" the anarchist “A,” and “STOP RAPING OUR FORESTS U.S.F.S.” Ferguson and Overtaker were part of a group calling themselves ""The Family,"" which proceeded to commit nearly 20 arson and ecotage attacks over a 6 year period. Upon fear of a life behind bars, Ferguson became a government informant and witness in the case, landing him a sentence of 2 years probation, and as of 2008, Overtaker remained a fugitive being sought by the government after being indicted for her involvement in the crimes.",Government (General),Earth Liberation Front (ELF)

One incendiary device was placed in a recycling dumpster at the southwest corner of the ranger station, and the second was planted on the outside of one of the walls of the station, causing an estimated $3,316,150 in damages to replace the building, and $1,758,039 for the contents, for a total loss of $5,074,189, in addition to a vast amount of lost research material. There were no casualties in the incident. The three selected the Oakridge Ranger Station for the target of this arson due to their familiarity with it during their opposition to the Warner Creek timber sale sometime earlier. The perpetrators were part of a group calling themselves ""The Family,"" which proceeded to commit nearly 20 arson and ecotage attacks over a 6 year period. Upon fear of a life behind bars, Ferguson became a government informant and witness in the case, landing him a sentence of 2 years probation, and as of 2008, Overtaker remained a fugitive being sought by the government after being indicted for her involvement in the crimes.
