No casualties resulted from the incident, but the attack caused damage to a wall of the building as well as shattered a window. Both Los Macheteros and the Organization of Volunteers for the Puerto Rican Revolution were responsible for the attack, which they claimed in a joint communiqué five days later, stating that the attack was in memory of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary, Juan Antonio Corretjer, who had died the week earlier, but as a poet and advocate of Puerto Rican Independence, he spent much of his life fighting against ""Yankee Imperialism.""",Government (General),Macheteros

198505150015,United States,34.097866,-118.407379,0.0,"05/15/1985: A pipe bomb exploded outside the front door of the Northridge home of Dr. George Ashley in San Fernando Valley, just 24 miles northwest of Los Angeles, California, United States. Dr. Ashley was a former high school teacher and an advisor at the Institute for Historical Review, a private research organization in Torrance, California, which has maintained that the Holocaust never occurred. No one was injured in the incident, but the blast destroyed the front door and caused about $1,000 in property damage. Prior to the explosion, the sidewalk outside the home had been spray-painted with the letters ""JDL.""  Though no one claimed credit for the bombing and the Jewish Defense League (JDL) actually denied responsibility, authorities believe it was the action of the JDL, as Ashley's house had been previously broken into and vandalized with slogans saying ""Never Again"" and ""No More Holocaust.""",Private Citizens & Property,Jewish Defense League (JDL)

Two white teenagers from the neighborhood were arrested as suspects and authorities were searching for additional suspects. The Gant family was one of few black families in the white Polish neighborhood, and authorities confirmed that the gasoline bombing was racially motivated. This was one of several in a wave of racially motivated incidents in the area as well as other states at the time.",Private Citizens & Property,White supremacists/nationalists

198506220006,United States,29.813822,-95.365295,0.0,"06/22/1985: Two bombs exploded in the Moslem prayer room at the Daar Us Salaam mosque in Houston, Texas, United States, about an hour after worshippers left the mosque. There were no casualties in the incident, but the explosions caused about $50,000 in damages. Daniel Allen Russell, Randy James Jones, and Stephen C. Ahern, all of Houston, were all charged and sentenced after their admissions to constructing and planting the bombs in the mosque. It appears that the perpetrators acted independently of any group, and their reasons for the bombing, while conflicting, are suspected to be in retaliation and anger over American hostages being held in Lebanon during the Shiite Moslem hijacking of passengers aboard TWA Flight 847. The bombing came in the midst of threatening phone calls to several area mosques and Islamic society headquarters after the hostage situation in Beirut.",Religious Figures/Institutions,Anti-Muslim extremists

198509060007,United States,40.778737,-73.230184,0.0,"09/06/1985: A bomb exploded at the home of Elmars Sprogis in Brentwood, New York, United States, a residential community in Suffolk County, about 40 miles east of Manhattan. Sprogis, and American citizen, was a former police chief in Nazi-occupied Latvia during World War II, and had been previously been accused of war crimes, but in deportation proceedings, all charges against him were dismissed. At the time of the incident, it is suspected that a fire was set at Sprogis' home in order to have him evacuate the home via the front door, where an explosive was planted on his front steps. Sprogis' neighbor Robert Seifried, saw the fire, and went to alert Sprogis, but inadvertently set off the bomb (meant for Sprogis), resulting in serious burns to his Seifried's right foot, leg and shoulder. Damage to the home included shattered windows, destroyed aluminum siding, and other minor damage. After the incident, two calls were made to Newsday newspaper from an unknown male, stating ""Listen carefully, Jewish Defense League, Nazi war criminal. Bomb. Never again.""  Though the JDL denied involvement in the incident, authorities believe the group was responsible.",Police,Jewish Defense League (JDL)
