199106100013,United States,44.563781,-123.279444,0.0,"06/10/1991: Members of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) set fire to storage and research buildings of the experimental mink farm at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon, in the United States, by planting at least six incendiary devices made with clocks, cans of Sterno and 9-volt batteries. The arson caused a total of $75,000 worth of damage including structural damage to the barn, which was used to store feed, animal bedding and smaller equipment as well as destroyed research documents and records, emptied files, and a broken toilet which caused flooding. There were no casualties in the incident, which was claimed by the group in a news release sent to the Associated Press in Portland, stating that the farm was targeted ""due to its role in the barbaric fur trade.""  ALF member, Rodney Coronado, who launched ""Operation Bite Back"" in 1991, a five-state arson campaign against the fur industry, was later captured and indicted on federal charges for this incident. He did not act alone, but the other perpetrators are unknown. Coronado spent three and a half years in prison for fur industry arsons.",Educational Institution,Animal Liberation Front (ALF)

The group claimed responsibility for the incident in separate news releases to the Associated Press and KIRO in Seattle, in which the group stated that the ""Western Wildlife Cell"" of ALF planted incendiaries in the building in order to cause maximum economic damage ""to an industry that profits from the misery and exploitation of fur animals."" ALF member, Rodney Coronado, who launched ""Operation Bite Back"" in 1991, a five-state arson campaign against the fur industry, was later captured and indicted on federal charges for this incident. He did not act alone, but the other perpetrators are unknown. Coronado spent three and a half years in prison for fur industry arsons.",Business,Animal Liberation Front (ALF)

There were no casualties in the incident. Although an anonymous telephone call was made to KGW-TV, claiming ALF was responsible for the incident, authorities were doubtful of the legitimacy of the call. Regardless, ALF member Rodney Coronado, who was responsible for several other arsons of fur industry facilities in his Operation Bite Back, was suspected to be linked to this case.",Business,Animal Liberation Front (ALF)
