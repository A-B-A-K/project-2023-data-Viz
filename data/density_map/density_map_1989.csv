There were no casualties in the incident, but the arson, which was caused by an incendiary device planted in the building, destroyed half of the two-story rural warehouse used for livestock auctions. After the incident, a male caller, identifying himself as a member of the Earth First! group, phoned the Associated Press in San Francisco and claimed responsibility for the incident, stating that the motive for targeting the livestock industry was ""because we are opposed to the livestock industry because it causes irreparable damage to the environment by putting chemicals in food and water and destroying natural habitat for wildlife. We will continue carrying out our actions against the livestock industry in the future until it stops.''",Business,Earth First!

One fire caused damage to the fifth-floor laboratory rooms of the Pharmacy-Microbiology building on the main campus and the second, to a converted residence that housed the office of the Animal Resources Division on the medical campus. Additionally, in letters sent to news organizations, ALF also claimed responsibility for freeing over 1,000 lab animals from the two facilities as well as a third, also on the campus. Some of the animals freed included mice infected with  the disease cryptosporidium, which has been known to be fatal in AIDS patients. No one was injured in the fires, which gutted the laboratories and partially damaged classrooms. The group's statement to the news was that the animals were freed ""from certain torture and death at the hands of U of A students and researchers.""",Educational Institution,Animal Liberation Front (ALF)

Only one of the firebombs ignited, and the morning crew smelled the smoke and fled the building. However, the small fire caused $1,000 worth of damage; there were no casualties in the incident. ALF claimed responsibility for the fire in a telephone call to the Associated Press in San Francisco, stating that their goal was to make ""animal abuse unprofitable.""",Business,Animal Liberation Front (ALF)

The two were trying to cut down the power line using a propane torch, similar to their previous incidents of terrorism in 1987 and 1988 at the Flagstaff, Arizona ski lifts and the power lines at the Grand Canyon, Arizona. The power pole was owned by the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Harcuvar Substation owned by the Central Arizona Project (CAP), which was the main source of water supply for Arizona. The perpetrators were arrested as they were at the location, about to carry out the attack, and thus, authorities believe much potential damage to the substation was prevented.",Government (General),Evan Mecham Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy (EMETIC)
