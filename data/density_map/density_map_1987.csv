There were no casualties in the incident.

The notes were slipped under the front door of a building in Sacramento housing offices of both The Associated Press and United Press International.

There were no casualties in the incident, but the arson caused about $10,000 in damages. An unidentified woman, claiming to be from ARM, called a news organization in San Francisco, California, about two hours after the fire and read a statement stating that ""the fire was in retaliation for the hundreds of thousands of veal calves stripped from their mothers at birth and forced to live in cramped wooden boxes for the full two months of their lives.""",Business,Animal Liberation Front (ALF)

198710050012,United States,35.1982,-111.651304,0.0,"10/05/1987:  Members of a group calling itself the ""Evan Mecham Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy"" (EMETIC), claimed responsibility for using an acetylene torch to cut through support bolts in twelve pylons connected to cables which held the main ski chairlift at the Fairfield Snow Bowl Ski Resort in Flagstaff, Arizona in the United States. The propane torches were used to cut the polls along the newest chairlift at Agassiz Peak, and additionally, the perpetrators smashed windows at the terminal stations at the top of the lift as well as at a building used by ski patrol in the winter. There were no casualties, but the property damage was estimated at $100,000. In a letter to local media outlets after the incident, the group stated more sabotage would follow.

In a letter to the ski resort, the group stated that ""if trees were not allowed to grow back"" and ""ski operations not discontinued,"" then more damage would occur.
