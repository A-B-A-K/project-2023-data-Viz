No one was injured as the office was unoccupied at the time of the shooting, just after midnight, but there was minor damage to windows, office equipment and furniture. This incident had racial motivations, and came in the midst of similar shootings of black newspapers including this one in previous months. Both perpetrators were arrested for the attack.",Journalists & Media,Ku Klux Klan

Dr. Ashley was a high school teacher in the Sun Valley area of L.A. and an advisor at the Institute for Historical Review, a private research organization in Torrance, California, which has maintained that the Holocaust never occurred. No one was injured in the incident, but the blast  caused about $1,000 in property damage. The perpetrators are unknown, but are suspected to be Jewish. A call was made to the Associated Press after the incident but much of it was incomprehensible; however, past calls claiming responsibility for attacks on Ashley's home were made in the name of ""Jewish Defenders."" Additionally, before the explosion, Ashley had received warning calls stating ""We will burn you alive with your family and give you a good Jewish lesson.""",Private Citizens & Property,Jewish Extremists
