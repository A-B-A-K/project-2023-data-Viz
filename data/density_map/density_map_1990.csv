As he was on his way to work, Kitchen was shot eight times with a .22-caliber handgun as he left his horse farm. After the incident, police warned veterinary college deans around the country , as a precaution, that based on an unconfirmed report, an animal rights extremist group threatened to kill one dean a month for the next year to protest laboratory research on animals, and that a militant underground animal rights faction may have been responsible for killing Kitchen, though the perpetrator of the incident was never identified and no one claimed responsibility.",Educational Institution,Unknown
