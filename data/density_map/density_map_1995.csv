The business was destroyed. Immediately following this incident, Priestley - armed with a shotgun and two pipe bombs - entered the nearby Lincoln Savage Middle School. Wielding his shotgun, Priestley threatened school officials and demanded a ride to an abortion clinic. He wanted to blow up a health care facility that performed abortions and kill a ""couple of doctors.""  However, his demands were unheeded  and, soon after, Priestley got into a scuffle with Damian McLean, the wrestling coach of the local high school. Priestley was shot and wounded in the hip with his own shotgun and subsequently apprehended by the police.",Abortion Related,Anti-Abortion extremists

The assailant, identified as Roland James Smith (aka Aboudima Moulika), was armed with a .38 caliber revolver and a canister of paint thinner. He shot and wounded four people before barricading himself and others inside the building and starting a fire that destroyed the first floor of the building. Smith shot and killed himself, and the fire killed seven others who were trapped in the store. Smith had been among protesters picketing the store in an ongoing landlord-tenant dispute with neighboring stores, which some protesters viewed as racially motivated. Witnesses reported that Smith carried out the attack because he mistakenly believed that the owner of the store was engaging in racially discriminatory hiring practices.",Business,Black Nationalists
