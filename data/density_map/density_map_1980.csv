198003120008,United States,18.386932,-66.061127,0.0,"03/12/1980: The Macheteros, a group advocating for the independence of Puerto Rico, claimed responsibility in a letter to a San Juan newspaper, for an ambush against a government vehicle carrying three US Army ROTC officers who were on their way to teach at the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The ambush left one serviceman slightly injured by broken glass which lightly grazed him. The vehicle, which had no government markings, had just left the Las Americas expressway at an exit about one mile from the University of Puerto Rico, where three to four men were hiding under an underpass. One perpetrator jumped out and opened fire on the government vehicle with a rifle, leaving 11 bullet holes in the vehicle. This was the second attack against US military personnel in Puerto Rico in four months but it is unclear whether this attack was linked to the December attack of a Navy Bus as that incident was claimed by three different Puerto Rican nationalist groups.",Military,Macheteros

The girl was in satisfactory condition and treated for her wounds. It is unknown whether any property damage occurred. This incident occurred a few hours after a demonstration protesting the treatment of blacks in the racially divided community. For several weeks prior to the incident, there had been unrest in the community between whites and blacks, with blacks protesting against racial, economic, and political injustices against them, asking for better jobs and representation in local government. The perpetrators, Herschel Hall and Danny Foskey, were arrested and charged with aggravated assault. It is uncertain whether the two are members of the Ku Klux Klan.",Private Citizens & Property,Ku Klux Klan

Stewart frequented the tavern which had a mostly white clientele and a white bartender, and the eight perpetrators conspired, prior to the incident,  to kill Stewart because of his race, and had even threatened him the month prior to the attack. After the attack in the parking lot failed to injure him, the perpetrators attempted to shoot him with automatic rifles at his residence and altogether fired 27 shots. Neither Stewart, nor any other individuals were wounded in either attack. Charles Furtaw, Donald Johnson, Raymond Eugene Echlin, Eugene John, Walter Belcher, Richard Johnson, Ronald Bishop, and Joseph Greenwell were the eight arrested and charged in the attack, and four of them pleaded guilty in court.",Private Citizens & Property,Ku Klux Klan

The molotov cocktail was thrown through a bedroom window of the home of Bruce Meggett and Lucinda Harris, who were not home at the time of the incident. Four children, ranging in ages from 6 years old to 15 years old, and their uncle were in the home when the lighted gasoline firebomb bounced off of the arm of the 6-year old girl and exploded, setting the home on fire. No one was injured in the incident, but the fire caused $7,800 in damages to the home. Though authorities believe that this incident had no involvement from the Ku Klux Klan, it occurred three weeks after the  Klan held its first public rally in the state in more than 70 years. However, the bombing was intended to intimidate the family and other black families in the area, and infringe upon the family's housing rights. Charles N. Metheny and Eugene R. Gilliland were arrested and indicted for the arson, and a third suspect was being sought by police.",Private Citizens & Property,White supremacists/nationalists

Vaughan was shot just three blocks from her parents home, where she lived in Youngstown, Ohio in the United States. The perpetrators, all three of whom were arrested and charged for Vaughan's murder, stated that they wanted to attack Black people out of revenge for being jumped by a group of Blacks previously. However, they shot Blacks at random, not specifically the people who attacked them. This attack occurred at a time when racial tensions were volatile in Youngstown, and violence against blacks across the nation in general was increasing, as was activity by the Ku Klux Klan, which lead to the perception of a conspiracy against blacks. This attack caused hysteria within the Black community.",Private Citizens & Property,White supremacists/nationalists
