During the two-hour siege, the men took three hostages, and destroyed computers and furniture, and spray painted slogans on walls. None of the hostages, nor any other individuals were injured during the rampage; two hostages escaped when police broke through the back doors of the building, and the third hostage was released after the perpetrators surrendered to police negotiators. A statement made by the Bonn headquarters of the People's Mujahideen stated the incident was in response to an Iranian air raid against the National Liberation Army (a military wing of the group) hiding in Iraq. All five suspects were arrested and charged for this incident.",Government (Diplomatic),Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK)

There were no casualties reported in the incident. This is linked to a similar incident on this day where members of ALF also firebombed the Utah State University office of Frederick Knowlton, the station director of the Project (102492b). Both incidents were claimed by ALF in an unsigned press release sent by fax to The Moscow-Pullman Daily News in Moscow, Idaho, stating that the raids were meant to slow the   genocidal war'' against native wildlife, and the actions of the group were ""nonviolent acts of self-defense on behalf of free and imprisoned coyotes everywhere.''  ALF member, Rodney Coronado, who launched ""Operation Bite Back"" in 1991, a five-state arson campaign against the fur industry, was later captured and indicted on federal charges for these incidents. He did not act alone, but the other perpetrators are unknown. Coronado spent three and a half years in prison for fur industry arsons.",Government (General),Animal Liberation Front (ALF)
