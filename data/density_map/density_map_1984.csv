In an attempt to divert authorities, they also placed a brown package containing a fake bomb at the Two Swabbies clothing outlet store nearby, and from the Mr. Steak restaurant near the bank, made a warning phone call about the fake bomb to police. At the bank, they handed the teller a note requesting money, which netted them $3,600 from the robbery, of which, $200 was sent to Bob Miles, a racist leader in Michigan, and another $100 given to the Aryan Nation group. There were no casualties in the incident.",Business,The Order (Silent Brotherhood)

In the midst of the robbery, the perpetrators, all but one, wearing bandannas over their faces, and one dressed in disguise as a woman, used a variety of firearms to stop the Brinks truck and its drivers and steal $3.6 million. During the event, one perpetrator held up a note, reading ""Get out or die"" (similar to the note used in the April 23 armored truck robbery in Seattle, Washington). Even though shots were fired, there were no injuries or casualties from the robbery. However, the tires of the Brinks truck were shot flat to stop it. Eventually, ten people were charged with the robbery.",Business,The Order (Silent Brotherhood)
