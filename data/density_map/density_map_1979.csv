The bomb was sent in a book, mailed to Reverend Timothy Majic, a Roman Catholic pastor of Sacred Heart Church, who also worked as an editor for the Morning Star, a Croatian-language newspaper published in Chicago. In the book, there were three batteries and what appeared to be dynamite in a hollowed out section. While disarming the device, detective George Timm lost part of his right index finger, and suffered cuts on his hand, face, and chest.

The march was in support of a mentally disabled black man who was charged with raping a white woman, and convicted by an all-white jury. During the march, Klansmen blocked the street, disobeyed police orders to allow the marchers to pass, and opened gunfire, injuring two black marchers and five law enforcements officials. Two Klansmen were also shot and wounded. In May 1984, ten Klansmen were charged in federal court for civil rights violations in a violent disruption of black marchers and police, and nine of the men were charged with the conspiracy of use of force or threat of force for purposes of intimidating parade participants because of their race. By January 1989, all ten Klan members had either been found guilty or pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them in this incident.",Private Citizens & Property,Ku Klux Klan
