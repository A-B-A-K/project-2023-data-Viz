During the incident, Kholya held hostage the 21 other passengers and crew members on the plane, and only released them after diverting the plane to land in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, once Kholya made a deal with Mexican officials for a plane ticket to Cuba in exchange for the release of the passengers. All the hostages were released unharmed. Kholya's motivation for hijacking the plane was because he was opposed to U.S. policy towards Iran and he wanted to make Americans aware of the conditions in Iran.",Airports & Aircraft,Iranian extremists

The arson was set by using a petroleum-based liquid mixed with motor oil or diesel fuel, and though the perpetrators are unknown, the Ku Klux Klan is suspected to be responsible for the attack as the Center had several legal cases pending against the KK and the organization is home to Klanwatch, a group that monitors activities of the KKK, educates the public and leads litigation. Additionally, the arson was set specifically to the office of the director of Klanwatch, Randall Williams. There were no injuries in the incident.",NGO,Ku Klux Klan

The explosions caused an estimated $180,000 in damages to the four-story hotel and its contents, and seriously injured one of three perpetrators, Stephen Paster, who suffered injuries to both hands, both arms, his face and torso from the first bomb. The second and third explosions caused minor injury to a police officer on the scene who was treated for smoke inhalation. Paster, who was not part of the Rajneeshee sect, was charged and convicted of arson and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Authorities suspected that he was part of a Muslim sect, and the incident has been attributed to Jamaat-al-Fuqra by sources, but this is unclear. Police were also searching for two other perpetrators who were believed to also be responsible for the incident.",Business,Jamaat-al-Fuqra

No casualties resulted from the attack; however, the blast caused shattered windows and frames, and damage to air conditioners and ceiling as well as minor damage to the U.S. Department of Agriculture nearby. There were at least three perpetrators in the attack. The Macheteros claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to the Associated Press in San Juan, at which time the caller expressed the group's support for the people of Grenada and opposition towards the US for the invasion of Grenada. Additionally, the group left communiqués which stated the blast was in protest of the policies of the U.S. and Ronald Reagan, who the Macheteros claim, took advantage of the people of Grenada to reestablish imperialism.",Government (General),Macheteros
