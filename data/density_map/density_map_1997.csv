All six bombs exploded, causing $1,000,000 in property damage. There were no casualties in the incident, and none of the 800 mink in the building were harmed. The same day, a caller phoned the KSL radio station, claiming responsibility for the incident in the name of ALF, and a second call was made to Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade, also claiming the incident in the name of animal rights activists, but there was no specific reference to a person or group. The perpetrators, Alexander David Slack, Clinton Colby Ellerman, Douglas Joshua Ellerman, Sean Albert Gautschy,  Adam Troy Peace, and Andrew Bishop, were arrested and indicted for their involvement in the incident and an alleged earlier attempt to bomb the co-op, which was aborted when they saw police presence. After a trial, Sean Albert Gautschy,  Adam Troy Peace, and Andrew Bishop were acquitted, while Clinton Ellerman was sentenced to 5 years in prison, Douglas Ellerman to 7 years (which was later reduced by 13 months); Slack committed suicide months prior to the trial.",Business,Animal Liberation Front (ALF)

One of the hijackers had fake explosives strapped to his chest; he threatened to blow up the plane unless it was rerouted to Cologne, Germany. In addition, the hijackers demanded the release of Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turkish man who was in prison in Italy for attempting to assassinate Pope John Paul in 1981. The assailants also requested an interview with a television station. After landing in Cologne, the two hijackers allowed five of the 80 passengers and crew to deplane.

The perpetrators drilled holes behind refrigeration units at the plant, poured ignitable liquid into the drilled holes, stuffed rags into the holes and placed buckets under the rags. Additionally, three separate incendiary devices, made of a mixture of soap, gasoline and diesel, and then blended into a gel, were placed in and around the buildings of the plant. One of the incendiaries ignited prematurely, causing the group to abandon the rest of the plan. The remaining two incendiaries failed to ignite due to malfunction. There were no casualties in the incident, but the fire caused over $1,000,000 in damage, destroying the facility and leaving it out of operation. A few days after the fire, a communiqué was put out by the Animal Liberation Front, claiming responsibility for the arson.",Business,Animal Liberation Front (ALF)

The perpetrators placed incendiary devices at three locations in the barn and at two other locations, next to and inside a new tractor parked near the barn, then released the 500 horses, and placed different locks on the gates to the access road to block first responders from the scene. There were no casualties in the incident. A dozen horses escaped, but were subsequently recaptured, and none were injured. The BLM Horse Corral was targeted because the perpetrators  had read an article about an auction of wild horses in which buyers would adopt the horses and then sell them at a higher price to slaughterhouses, so the group wanted to ""help halt the BLM’s illegal and immoral business of rounding up wild horses from public lands and funneling them to slaughter,"" as they stated in their released communiqué, claiming responsibility for the incident.",Government (General),Animal Liberation Front (ALF)
