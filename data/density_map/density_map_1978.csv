Cikoja was on his way to his own car, when he collapsed on the front stoop. Croatian nationalists are suspected to be responsible for the incident because Cikoja had received a threat letter , three months prior to his murder, from a group calling itself the ""Croatian Nationalist Army"", demanding that he pay $5,000 by August towards the group's cause for independence, or otherwise he would be killed. He refused to pay the money. At least fifteen other Yugoslav immigrants in the metropolitan area had received similar letters.",Private Citizens & Property,Otpor

Ryan had initially gone to Guyana to investigate abuses of members of the “Peoples’ Temple,” founded by Reverend Jim Jones. After being threatened with a knife by one of the members, Ryan decided to cut his visit short. As he was boarding an aircraft to leave, reports claim that between 8 and 12 members of the cult were responsible for firing approximately 50 shots. The shots killed three American investigators traveling with Jones, as well as an 18-year-old American woman who was trying to leave. Larry John Leyton, a man posing as a defector, was the only person charged in America for involvement in the murder. Jones organized the murder of Ryan and members of his party in order to keep them from revealing the true conditions at Jonestown.",Government (General),People's Temple

Whitfield survived and was treated for his wounds. The Ku Klux Klan claimed responsibility for the attack and stated that Whitfield had no business being in Alabama and that the beating will teach him to stay out; the motive was that Whitfield had denounced the rape conviction of black man Tommy Lee Hines, for raping a white woman. Earlier this day, Whitfield preached for three hours on the steps of the Cullman County courthouse, at which time he denounced the conviction, and was taunted by whites. Whitfield initially refused to press charges against the perpetrators, but then later agreed to testify before a Federal grand jury.",Religious Figures/Institutions,Ku Klux Klan
