Seward stated that the men attempted to collect debts they believed he owed them after accusing Seward of being a government agent and traitor. The men cut Seward's hair, and threatened his life and the lives of his family members, and told him they knew where he ""cashed his government paycheck,"" all of which was untrue. Timothy Wayne Snider and Richard Lee Roberts were arrested and charged with kidnapping. One day prior to the incident, a Klansman called the Commercial Appeal newspaper and stated that a traitor to the Klan would be disciplined the next day, and then after the incident, another call came through notifying that the deed was done and the man could be found near the east Memphis area, where Seward was released.",Private Citizens & Property,Ku Klux Klan

No casualties resulted in the incident, but the blasts caused minor damage. Prior to the bombing, the owner of the store, an Armenian American, had received an extortion letter from the Armenian Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA), demanding a $150,000 contribution and stating that the money would help finance the group's cause of liberating their enslaved land and giving their people its national honor and dignity. In 1987, ASALA member, Vicken Tcharkhutian, was eventually arrested for this attack, admitted his involvement in court, and was sentenced to 12 years in prison for this as well as other incidents.",Business,Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia

There was minor damage to the building, and no casualties resulted from the incident. About two hours before the blast, an anonymous caller told the Associated Press, United Press International, and the City News Service, in Los Angeles, that a bomb had been planted by a group named the Jewish Defenders.

The arson did not cause damage to the main chancery building, but did cause $5,000 worth of damage to the garage on the property as well as minor smoke damage to surrounding office buildings. No casualties resulted from the incident. The Black Brigade claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to the Washington Post after the incident, and left a letter at the rear of the chancery noting that the attack was in response to the execution of five members of Liberia's ruling People's Redemption Council, who were also political opponents of Liberia's military leader.",Government (General),Black Brigade (United States)

198108270032,United States,18.42902,-66.015859,0.0,"08/27/1981: Two bombs exploded at an electric substation outside of the Isla Verde International Airport in Laguna Gardens, Puerto Rico, a suburb of San Juan and Carolina. The explosions caused $30,000 in damages and left hundreds of residents in Laguna Gardens without power for two hours. There were no casualties. Two additional bombs were also found, but did not detonate due to damage of critical components of the devices caused by the first two explosions, and the bombs were subsequently deactivated by authorities. In a call to a San Juan radio station, Grupo Estrella claimed responsibility for the blasts, which coincided with a nine-day strike by 6,700 power authority workers against the Puerto Rican Electric and Power Authority, in demand of higher wages.",Utilities,Grupo Estrella
