                        <p>Welcome to "Mapping the Shadows: An Interactive Journey Through Five Decades of Global
                            Terrorism", an interactive data
                            visualization project that invites you to explore the complex landscape of global terrorism
                            from 1970 to 2020. By
                            leveraging the power of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), our goal is to provide an
                            engaging and informative
                            experience that sheds light on the trends, patterns, and impacts of terrorist activities
                            worldwide.</p>

                        <p>In this project, you will find a variety of visualizations, including histograms, heatmaps,
                            and parallel coordinate
                            plots, all designed to present the data in a clear and accessible manner. At the heart of
                            our project is an
                            interactive map that adapts to your selections, allowing you to examine different aspects of
                            terrorism, such as the
                            density of attacks, fatalities per country, and seasonality, among others.</p>

                        <p>We believe that understanding the historical context and trends of terrorism is essential for
                            fostering informed
                            conversations and decision-making in our increasingly interconnected world. Please note that
                            this project deals with
                            sensitive subject matter, and we have made every effort to present the information in an
                            unbiased and respectful
                            manner.</p>
